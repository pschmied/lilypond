Beat grouping within a measure is controlled by the context property
@code{beatStructure}.  Values of @code{beatStructure} are established
for many time signatures in @file{scm/time-signature-settings.scm}.
Values of @code{beatStructure} can be changed or set with @code{\\set}.
Alternatively, @code{\\time} can be used to both set the time signature
and establish the beat structure. For this, you specify the internal
grouping of beats in a measure as a list of numbers (in Scheme syntax)
before the time signature.

@code{\\time} applies to the @code{Timing} context, so it will not
reset values of @code{beatStructure} or @code{baseMoment} that are set
in other lower-level contexts, such as @code{Voice}.

If the @code{Measure_grouping_engraver} is included in one of the
display contexts, measure grouping signs will be created.  Such signs
ease reading rhythmically complex modern music. In the example, the 9/8
measure is grouped in two different patterns using the two different
methods, while the 5/8 measure is grouped according to the default
setting in @file{scm/time-signature-settings.scm}:
